# Thread Impersonation Privilege Hijacking

## **Description**
This project demonstrates an advanced technique for **privilege impersonation** using another thread within a target process. The key objectives are:
1. Identify a thread belonging to a process with elevated privileges.
2. Hijack the execution of that thread.
3. Redirect its execution to an arbitrary code payload (shellcode).
4. Perform privileged operations via thread impersonation.

## **Motivation**
The **Thread Hijacking with Impersonation** technique is a low-level approach that leverages thread permissions and execution context on Windows. It is useful for:
- Conducting security testing and vulnerability assessments.
- Demonstrating how attackers can exploit threads to escalate privileges.
- Providing a hands-on understanding of Windows Internals and thread management.

## **Features**
- **Thread Enumeration**: Enumerates threads within a target process using the Windows API.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Identifies threads with elevated tokens for impersonation.
- **Thread Hijacking**: Redirects the instruction pointer (RIP/EIP) of a hijacked thread to execute custom shellcode.
- **Shellcode Injection**: Allocates memory in the target process, writes shellcode, and ensures its execution within a hijacked thread.

## **Requirements**
1. **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later (x64 recommended).
2. **Development Environment**: Visual Studio or any C++ compiler supporting Windows APIs.
3. **Privileges**: The program must be executed with administrative privileges to access and manipulate other processes and threads.
4. **Tools for Testing**:
   - Process Hacker or Process Explorer: To monitor threads and injected code.
   - WinDbg or x64dbg: To debug the process and analyze execution.

## **Usage**
1. Compile the program using Visual Studio or another compatible compiler.
2. Run the program as an administrator.
3. Provide the **PID** (Process ID) of the target process when prompted.
4. Monitor the program's output for logs indicating thread identification, privilege impersonation, and shellcode execution.

## **How It Works**
1. **Privilege Enablement**: Enables `SeDebugPrivilege` to access other processes and threads.
2. **Thread Discovery**: Enumerates all threads in the target process and checks for elevated tokens.
3. **Thread Hijacking**:
   - Suspends a thread.
   - Redirects its instruction pointer to the injected shellcode.
   - Resumes the thread for shellcode execution.
4. **Shellcode Execution**: Executes custom payloads (e.g., MessageBox, or other operations) within the target's context.

## **Future Improvements**
1. **Dynamic Shellcode Loading**:
   - Allow users to load custom shellcode dynamically instead of hardcoding it into the program.
2. **Support for Multi-Thread Hijacking**:
   - Enhance the program to hijack multiple threads in parallel for more complex operations.
3. **Evading Detection**:
   - Implement stealth techniques to evade detection by EDR and antivirus solutions.
   - Use indirect syscalls to bypass user-mode API hooks.
4. **Cross-Architecture Compatibility**:
   - Add support for x86 and ARM64 architectures for broader testing.
5. **Enhanced Logging and Debugging**:
   - Provide detailed logs and error handling for easier debugging and transparency.
6. **Thread Selection Criteria**:
   - Implement more granular criteria to select the best thread for impersonation, such as CPU usage or state.
